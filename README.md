** This project is built using React Native and Expo and is built for Android devices.

** STRICTLY FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION below for developing to avoid any unnecessary conflict in the repository:
  - To work with this project, make sure to install NodeJS (LTS version recommended), Expo (and optionally yarn for optimal installing package time).
  - If you have an Android device, make sure to install Expo Go to preview the app, or you can download Android Studio and config a Virtual Android device.
  - Before building the new feature, remember to pull the latest version of code from the GitHub server and create a new branch for the feature you are working on (develop/<feature_name>) and push it when you finish developing that feature.
  - You are only allowed to work on ONE FEATURE at a time and only one for each BRANCH. 
  - You must push your code to the GitHub server for the other members to review and merge it to the main branch if your code is OK.
  - Only after your old feature is accepted and merged into the main branch, you are allowed to work on the next feature.
  - To work with the project, open a terminal in the project folder, from which you will run all the command lines needed.
  - On the first time working with the project, remember to install all the dependencies by running the command "npm install" (or "yarn install").
  - To start the developing server and run the project, run the command "npx expo start". When the QR code is shown, open Expo Go app and the QR code (or simply press 'a' if you use a virtual machine, remember to open the virtual machine first).
  - For more information about Expo, please read the official documents (https://docs.expo.dev/).

** Now you are good to go!
